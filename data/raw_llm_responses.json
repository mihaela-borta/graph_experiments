  "Epic\u2019s latest tool can animate hyperrealistic MetaHumans with an iPhone: Today, Epic is releasing a new tool designed to capture an actor\u2019s facial performance using a device as simple as an iPhone and apply it to a hyperrealistic \u201cMetaHuman\u201d in the Unreal Engine in \u201cminutes.\u201d The feature, dubbed MetaHuman Animator, was detailed at the Game Developers Conference in March but is now available for developers to try out for themselves. Epic has also released a new video today produced by one of its internal teams to show what the tool is capable of.\nWhile Epic\u2019s short film shows off some impressively subtle facial animation, the big benefit the company is emphasizing is the speed with which MetaHuman Animator produces results. \u201cThe animation is produced locally using GPU hardware, with the final animation available in minutes,\u201d the company\u2019s press release reads. That has the potential to not just save a studio money by making performance capture more efficient but also, Epic argues, it could allow them to experiment and be more creative.\n\u201cNeed an actor to give you more, dig into a different emotion, or simply explore a new direction?\u201d Epic\u2019s press release asks. \u201cHave them do another take. You\u2019ll be able to review the results in about the time it takes to make a cup of coffee.\u201d Facial animation can be applied to a MetaHuman character \u201cin just a few clicks,\u201d Epic says, and the system is even smart enough to animate a character\u2019s tongue based on the performance\u2019s audio.\nPerformance capture using iPhones has been possible in the Unreal Engine since at least 2020 with the launch of Epic\u2019s Live Link Face iOS app, but now, it\u2019s combined with the high level of detail promised by Epic\u2019s MetaHuman technology. As well as working on the iPhone 12 and up (which is capable of capturing both video and depth data), Epic says MetaHuman Animator can also be used with \u201cexisting vertical stereo head-mounted camera [systems] to achieve even greater fidelity.\u201d\nEpic says the Blue Dot short film released today should give some idea of what its animation tool is capable of. It was produced by Epic Games\u2019 3Lateral team and stars actor Radivoje Bukvi\u0107 delivering a monologue based on a poem by Mika Anti\u0107. Although Epic says it\u2019s possible to tweak animation post-capture, it claims \u201cminimal interventions\u201d were made on top of the MetaHuman Animator\u2019s performance capture to achieve these results.\nIf you want to learn more, Epic has released an instructional video on how to use the tool.

  "EU to Ban Huawei, ZTE from Internal Commission Networks: The European Commission is planning to ban equipment from Chinese vendors Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. from its own internal telecommunications networks, people familiar with the matter said.\nThe ban comes ahead of an anticipated update to the European Union\u2019s guidance on 5G mobile networks within the bloc that\u2019s expected to more forcefully encourage members to phase out equipment from the companies, which it considers high risk, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plan isn\u2019t yet public.\nAs the relationship between the US and its allies and China has deteriorated, countries have blocked Chinese technology from their core telecommunications networks because of spying concerns.

  "Ryanair sacks chief pilot over sexual misconduct claims: Reuters\nRyanair has sacked its chief pilot after an investigation into his alleged sexual harassment of female colleagues.\nThe airline told staff that he had been fired for \"a pattern of repeated inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour towards a number of female pilots\".\nThe chief pilot, named in reports as Aidan Murray was appointed in 2020 and had been with the airline for 28 years.\nRyanair declined to comment \"on queries relating to individual employees\".\nAccording to The Independent, Mr Murray allegedly harassed nine junior colleagues, including sending text messages to some with comments on their bodies.\nMr Murray, 58, is also accused of altering flight rosters to fly with certain female pilots.\nIn a note to staff, Ryanair's chief people officer, Darrell Hughes, said Mr Murray's employment had been \"terminated with immediate effect\".\nAn investigation found his behaviour \"was in breach of our anti-harassment policy\". Ryanair said staff should be able to come to work \"in a safe and secure environment\".\n\"We would ask all of you to respect the privacy and integrity of those brave individuals who came forward to assist us in this investigation,\" Mr Hughes added.\nThe Financial Times reported that Mr Murray has seven days to launch an appeal against his dismissal.\nThe BBC has attempted to contact Mr Murray for comment.\nThe job of chief pilot is an important one. The holder is both a highly qualified airline captain and a manager, responsible for overseeing other pilots based at a hub airport.\nThey are usually in charge of issues such as training, flight coordination and rostering as well as addressing personal issues. They can also represent the airline in disciplinary issues.\nAs such, they have a lot of power over their fellow pilots, particularly more junior ones seeking promotions.\nThe suggestion that someone in this position might be abusing their power - and behaving in an \"inappropriate and unacceptable\" way towards female staff - is therefore a very serious charge.\nIt's important to note that we haven't heard the other side of the story. But it appears that whistleblowers have come forward - and have been listened to.\nAgainst that background, the dismissal should come as no surprise.\nA report last year by the Royal Aeronautical Society into discrimination and lack of diversity in airline pilot training found \"extremely concerning\" reports of sexism and sexual harassment by many female pilots.\nAlthough many had positive comments on their training, reports of sexism and harassment ranged from \"banter\" to \"uncomfortable advances from male trainers\".\nRelated Topics\nSexual harassment\nRyanair\nMore on this story\nPilot, 15, wants to inspire more women into gliding\n2 hours ago\nHeathrow workers call off first summer strikes\n2 days ago": "```\n(\"entity\"$$$$Ryanair$$$$Organization$$$$Ryanair is a major European airline known for its low-cost flights.

  "Vivo X90s Officially Teased, Tipped to Run on New MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC: Vivo X90s has been teased by Jia Jingdong, Vivo's Vice President and General Manager of Product Strategy via Weibo on Thursday. The new smartphone has a design similar to its Vivo X90 series siblings \u2014 Vivo X90 and Vivo X90 Pro. The Vivo X90s is shown to have a Zeiss-tuned triple rear camera unit. The upcoming model is expected to retain the key specification of the Vivo X90. Meanwhile, Chinese tipsters have leaked the specifications of the upcoming handset. The Vivo X90s is said to run on MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC and could be offered in four different colour options.\nJia Jingdong posted an image of the Vivo X90s on the Chinese microblogging platform providing us a glimpse of the design from the rear. The render shows the handset in a white finish with rounded corners. The image suggests Zeiss branded triple rear cameras on the rear panel along with an LED flash. It seems to have a glass back with the Vivo branding at the bottom.\nVivo, however, didn't confirm the exact launch date or key specifications of the Vivo X90s.\nSeparately, several Chinese tipsters posted specifications of the upcoming Vivo X90s on Weibo. According to the tipsters, the handset will be powered by the latest MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC. This would be an upgrade over the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 SoC found on the vanilla Vivo X90.

  "UnitedHealth's stock selloff chopped more than 200 points off the Dow's price: Health insurer's stock suffers second-biggest price decline since it starting trading 39 years ago\nShares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. took a dive Wednesday to suffer their worst percentage performance in three years, after the health insurer said it was facing higher costs from pent-up demand for surgeries.\nThe stock (UNH) was by far the biggest decliner within the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and was among the worst performers in the S&P 500 , along with fellow health insurers with Medicare Advantage exposure.\nUnitedHealth's stock dropped 6.4% to a one-year closing low of $459.86. That was the biggest percentage decline since it sank 7.2% on June 11, 2020.\nThe stock's price decline of $31.45 was the second-biggest since it started trading in October 1984, behind only the $47.00 (17.3%) plunge on March 16, 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe selloff was cut about 207 points off the Dow's price, as the Dow fell 232.79 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.1%.\nThe selloff comes after Chief Financial Officer John Rex said late Tuesday at a Goldman Sachs investor conference that there were indications of \"pent-up demand\" from senior citizens to have hip and knee procedures and cardiology checkups, which could hurt results from UnitedHealth's Medicare business.\nOppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn said while other insurers that presented at recent conferences didn't mention similar trends, he believed UnitedHealth's comments will weigh on the entire sector.\nHe said rival Humana Inc. (HUM) was potentially the most exposed, given its larger Medicare Advantage presence. And on cue, Humana's stock was the S&P 500's biggest decliner, tumbling 13.8%.\nSome of the S&P 500's other big losers were also in the Medicare Advantage business, as Centene Corp.'s (CNC) stock sank 6.9%, Elevance Health Inc. (ELV) shares shed 6.8% and CVS Health Corp.'s (CVS) stock slid 7.8%.\nUnitedHealth's stock has an outsized impact on the Dow's price\nUnitedHealth's stock is the highest-priced component of the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, unlike the S&P 500, which is a market-capitalization-weighted index. That means the stock's moves affect the Dow more than any other component.\nAt Wednesday's closing prices, a 1% move in UnitedHealth's stock represents about a 30-point move in the Dow, while a 1% move in Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s (WBA) stock, which is the lowest priced, has about a 2-point effect on the Dow.\n-Tomi Kilgore\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

  "Houston Texans Come To Terms With Ex-Third-Round Pick Defensive Tackle: KEY POINTS\nThe Texans have signed Maliek Collins to a two-year deal\nCollins becomes latest defensive player to settle a contract with a mother team\nJ.J. Watt has yet to properly file his retirement with the NFL\nThe Houston Texans have ramped up their defensive needs with the reported signing of Maliek Collins on Wednesday, June 14.\nAccording to Adam Schefter of ESPN, both sides sealed the deal on a contract extension with Collins accepting a $23 million contract extension.\n\"The deal was negotiated by Texans' GM Nick Caserio and director of football administration Andrew Brown with Collins' agents Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha,\" the scribe wrote on his Twitter post\nThe new deal gives Collins a bit of a raise and reportedly includes a $20 million guarantee.\nIn his previous contract, the 28-year-old was earning $17 million with $8.5 million of that guaranteed.\nThis will be his third year in the NFL, having had previous stops with the Dallas Cowboys (2016-2019) and the Las Vegas Raiders (2020).\nThe Kansas native had a career-high 37 tackles to go with 3.5 sacks over 15 games last NFL season.\nHe is projected to be a key piece in the defensive line of the Texans for the next couple of years.\nLooking ahead, Collins is expected to fit in nicely with the 4-3 alignment that DeMeco Ryans is expected to implement.\nHe is likely to become a full-time defensive tackle according to Sam Robison of Pro Football Talk.\nWith the Texans in rebuilding mode, Collins was seen as one of the bright spots for the team. He started 15 games between 2021 and 2022, combining for six sacks and 18 tackles for a loss.\nNow, he will be paid better, which means he will have added responsibility\u2013particularly on the defensive side of the Texans' fence.\nThe Collins deal also comes not long after other defensive tackles landed new deals with their respective teams. That list includes Dexter Lawrence, Daron Payne, Jeffery Simmons and Ed Oliver.\nThere are still other names expected to land new contracts this NFL offseason. Yet to come to terms with their teams include Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs and Quinnen Williams of the New York Jets.\nIn related news, there remain questions in the air on whether J.J. Watt is officially retired.\nAccording to a report by CBS Sports, Watt has yet to fill out his retirement papers with the NFL.\nThis was despite his retiring last NFL season in an emotional game that saw him record two sacks in his allegedly final NFL game.\nMoreover, the five-time first-team All-Pro does not intend to sign a one-day deal with the Texans although this is tied to him being inducted into the club's Ring of Honor.\n\"I personally just don't really understand or see the reason for it,\" Watt stated. \"It's more just a ceremonial piece of paper.

  "Supplier.io and Hyatt Hotels Honored With 2023 Top Supply Chain Projects Award by Supply & Demand Chain Executive: CHICAGO, June 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Supplier.io, the premier SaaS provider of supplier diversity data and management solutions, today announced that it and customer Hyatt Hotels received a Supply & Demand Chain Executive 2023 Top Supply Chain Projects award.

Their success shows you how quickly an organization can grow and scale their supplier diversity program when all stakeholders are empowered with the tools and information to make more responsible sourcing decisions.\"\nHyatt has prioritized supplier diversity since 1997, but manual processes and decentralized decision-making made it challenging to quantify the full results of their efforts.

  "State Street (NYSE:STT) shareholders have endured a 13% loss from investing in the stock five years ago: In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 25% over a half decade. In contrast, the stock price has popped 9.8% in the last thirty days. However, this may be a matter of broader market optimism, since stocks are up 6.8% in the same time.\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\nView our latest analysis for State Street\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, State Street actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 6.1% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.\nBecause of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.\nRevenue is actually up 0.5% over the time period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nState Street is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for State Street in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.\nWe're pleased to report that State Street shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over one year. That's including the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions.

The Spaniard has been one of United\u2019s best players since joining in 2011 but was inconsistent last season and Erik ten Hag wants to bring in a goalkeeper.\nUnited are weighing up their next move after becoming discouraged in their pursuit of Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane. Signing a top striker is a priority for Ten Hag but Spurs do not want to sell Kane and Napoli\u2019s asking price for Victor Osimhen is prohibitive. Atalanta\u2019s Rasmus H\u00f8jlund is a target, but the Dane is one for the future.\nUnited must also decide whether to improve their offer for the Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount, after having an opening bid of \u00a340m turned down. They could decide to spend heavily on a goalkeeper if they cannot sign a world-class No 9.\nDe Gea was at fault for Manchester City\u2019s winner in the FA Cup final and his unconvincing distribution has raised doubts over whether the 32-year-old is suited to Ten Hag\u2019s football. Chelsea and United have registered an interest in Onana with Inter, whose financial problems could force them to sell. It is believed the Cameroon international would favour a move to United. Costa is an alternative target for Ten Hag. The 23-year-old is highly rated and a Portugal international.\nOnana is excellent with the ball at his feet and impressed during Inter\u2019s run to the Champions League final, where they were beaten 1-0 by Manchester City. Inter fear they will lose Onana and have inquired about Brentford\u2019s David Raya, who is wanted by Tottenham.\nSigning Onana would fix a problem area for Chelsea, who will listen to offers for Kepa Arrizabalaga and \u00c9douard Mendy. Arrizabalaga\u2019s high wages could make him harder to sell than Mendy, who lost his place to the Spaniard last season. Chelsea have also targeted Milan\u2019s Mike Maignan and Valencia\u2019s Giorgi Mamardashvili.\nChelsea have held talks with Inter over a number of issues this week. Along with discussing Onana, Inter have explored signing Kalidou Koulibaly and Romelu Lukaku on loan. Chelsea need to raise funds and would prefer to sell Koulibaly and Lukaku.\nChelsea want \u00a370m plus add-ons for Mount. They are expected to sell Mateo Kovacic to Manchester City and want \u00a370m for Kai Havertz, who is a target for Arsenal.": "```\n(\"entity\"$$$$Manchester United$$$$Football Club$$$$Manchester United is a professional football club based in Manchester, England.

  "Real Madrid or Inter could give Man City fixture nightmare in Premier League and Champions League: Manchester City's fixture list for 2023/24 has thrown up plenty of nuances, with extremely difficult runs of games in October and March.\nFrom October, City face Arsenal, Brighton, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham in the space of seven Premier League fixtures, and the same group of games are reversed in the Spring.\nIn March, City will play United, Liverpool, Brighton and Arsenal all in a row, and around key Champions League fixtures to make the task even more difficult.\nWith six Champions League group games before Christmas, the fixture computer has thrown up some potentially difficult weeks where City are in European action either side of games that could turn out to be crucial in the league.\nALSO READ: Pep Guardiola's most feared fixture will come at the worst time for Man City treble defence\nThe Champions League group stage kicks off on September 19/20, in between a trip to West Ham and a home fixture with Nottingham Forest.\nThe second matchday of the group stage comes on October 3 or 4 after a trip to Wolves and before an eagerly-anticipated clash with Arsenal at the Etihad.\nLater in October, City host Brighton, then play their next Champions League fixture on October 24 or 25, before travelling to Manchester United for the first derby of the season.\nThe matchday four fixtures are on November 7 or 8, and come in between a home clash with Bournemouth and a potentially tricky trip to Chelsea.\nAfter the November international break, City welcome Liverpool in the Premier League, face a crucial matchday five on November 28 or 29 in Europe, and then host Tottenham immediately afterwards.\nThe final matchday - where City will hope to have secured qualification - comes between a first trip to Kenilworth Road to take on Luton, and a home meeting with Crystal Palace.\nCity are guaranteed a place in Pot One in the Champions League after winning the competition but could face Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig or Porto from Pot Two. Selected other teams across Pots Three and Four include AC Milan, Real Sociedad and Celtic.\nThat means City could face a run of fixtures like Liverpool at home, Real Madrid away, and Tottenham at home - or Brighton at home, Inter Milan away, and Manchester United away.\nAssuming City qualify for the last-16, the first leg could take place on one of two midweeks in February. Either it could be played in between Premier League home fixtures against Everton and Chelsea, or it could be played between the Chelsea game and a trip to Bournemouth.\nThe second leg will be played in the middle of a difficult March fixture list, either between United at home and Liverpool away, or between Liverpool away and Brighton away.\nShould City progress to the quarter-finals, the first leg will come after the trip to Crystal Palace and before the visit of Luton. The second leg, a week later, will be played before the ever-difficult trip to Tottenham. However, should City or Spurs reach the FA Cup semi-finals, that would likely cause the Premier League game to be rearranged.\nOn to the potential semi-finals, and City face Nottingham Forest away before the first legs on April 30 or May 1.

  "Tesla short sellers are down billions after stock's winning streak: It's been an 'unprofitable trade' for Tesla shorts so far, analyst says\nTesla Inc. stock took a breather on Wednesday, snapping a 13-day winning streak, but it has more than doubled so far this year, creating a multibillion-dollar headache for those betting that the shares would fall.\nThere has been an increase in Tesla (TSLA) short selling for all of 2023, but \"we've recently seen short covering as its stock price has been rallying,\" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at financial analytics firm S3 Partners. \"This has been a very unprofitable trade for Tesla short sellers.\"\nTesla shares on Tuesday ended at their highest since late September after gaining for 13 straight sessions.\nReal-time short-interest data from S3 Partners shows that Tesla shorts were down about $816 million in mark-to-market losses based on Tuesday's 3.5% jump for the stock.\nShorts have lost $12.68 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses, down 80%; they are down $5.05 billion, or 24%, so far in June. They had $15.85 billion in mark-to-market profits in 2022.\nSee also: Elon Musk? Jay Powell? Tell MarketWatch who the 50 most influential people in markets are today\n\"With [Tesla's] stock price continuing its recent upward trend we should see continued short covering as the [Tesla] short squeeze tightens its hold on short sellers, especially those with less conviction,\" Dusaniwsky said.\nAfter a difficult April, when it fell 20%, Tesla stock was on a tear in May, and has kept that up in June, gaining about 60% in the period. For the year, the stock has gained 110%, which compares with an advance of about 14% for the S&P 500 index.\nThe most recent gains for the stock came as Tesla saw its fast-charging standard becoming the de facto standard in the U.S.\nLast week, Tesla and General Motors Co. announced that GM EV owners would have access to Tesla's \"Supercharger\" network, usually located near major highways.\nGM also said that its future EVs would conform to the Tesla-developed North America Charging Standard, or NACS, by 2025, and before that the automaker would offer an adapter. That follows a similar move by Ford Motor Co. last month\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said back in July 2021 that he would open Tesla's Supercharger to other EVs, although he promised that would happen by the end of 2021.\nTesla created its own connector because there were no standards when it became the only maker of long-range EVs, Musk said then.\nOther EVs began to be allowed to charge at Tesla's fast-charging stations last year, but the GM (GM) and Ford (F) announcements brought the matter to the forefront.\nGM, Ford and other automakers currently use the Combined Charging System, or CCS, as their charging connection, which is standard in most EVs in Europe and other regions. Tesla has made NACS open source, which means more products that use it are hitting the market.\nSee related:Tesla again raises starting price of Model Y by $250 in U.S\n-Claudia Assis\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Epic has also released a new video today produced by one of its internal teams to show what the tool is capable of.\nWhile Epic\u2019s short film shows off some impressively subtle facial animation, the big benefit the company is emphasizing is the speed with which MetaHuman Animator produces results. \u201cThe animation is produced locally using GPU hardware, with the final animation available in minutes,\u201d the company\u2019s press release reads. That has the potential to not just save a studio money by making performance capture more efficient but also, Epic argues, it could allow them to experiment and be more creative.\n\u201cNeed an actor to give you more, dig into a different emotion, or simply explore a new direction?\u201d Epic\u2019s press release asks. \u201cHave them do another take. You\u2019ll be able to review the results in about the time it takes to make a cup of coffee.\u201d Facial animation can be applied to a MetaHuman character \u201cin just a few clicks,\u201d Epic says, and the system is even smart enough to animate a character\u2019s tongue based on the performance\u2019s audio.\nPerformance capture using iPhones has been possible in the Unreal Engine since at least 2020 with the launch of Epic\u2019s Live Link Face iOS app, but now, it\u2019s combined with the high level of detail promised by Epic\u2019s MetaHuman technology. As well as working on the iPhone 12 and up (which is capable of capturing both video and depth data), Epic says MetaHuman Animator can also be used with \u201cexisting vertical stereo head-mounted camera [systems] to achieve even greater fidelity.\u201d\nEpic says the Blue Dot short film released today should give some idea of what its animation tool is capable of. It was produced by Epic Games\u2019 3Lateral team and stars actor Radivoje Bukvi\u0107 delivering a monologue based on a poem by Mika Anti\u0107. Although Epic says it\u2019s possible to tweak animation post-capture, it claims \u201cminimal interventions\u201d were made on top of the MetaHuman Animator\u2019s performance capture to achieve these results.\nIf you want to learn more, Epic has released an instructional video on how to use the tool.

The user, who goes by profile name \u2018gsratta\u2019 on Team-bhp forum, said that he received a text message from Paytm stating that his Fastag has been blacklisted due to insufficient balance. When he checked the Paytm app, he saw that he had been charged Rs 9 crore whereas normal toll at the same toll plaza is Rs90.\n\u201cToday I received a text message from Paytm, that the Fastag of my vehicle has been blacklisted, due to insufficient balance, on checking in the Paytm application, I came to know that they had charged a whopping Nine crores ( yes that is true) see the attached screenshots. A popup came up to add \u20b9 90000000/- to the Paytm wallet to continue using the fastag. Normal toll at the same toll plaza is \u20b990. Contacted the helpline number, but it was not useful. How to proceed now. Please advise,\u201d gsratta wrote on Team-bhp.\nThe user said that they contacted Paytm customer service, but they were unable to resolve the issue.\nAlso Read: Wrestlers row: No evidence found to press POCSO charge against Brij Bhushan, says Delhi Police in 550-page chargesheet\n\u201cThe helpline automated system would not let me talk to a customer care person, instead it required me to raise the issue, in the Help & Support section of the Paytm Application. The result from the same was inconclusive. It doesn\u2019t allow screenshots in the Help & Support section, so had to take pictures using another device,\u201d he added.\nAnother Team-bhp member \u2018Emvi\u2019 meanwhile, shared a screenshot showing he was charged Rs 1.5 crore.\nBoth Emvi and gsratta, however, later confirmed in the forum that the issues were attributed to technical glitches and were subsequently resolved.\nThese were not first times for Paytm Fastag users to have been charged an exorbitant amount for toll. In 2022, a user was charged Rs 2 lakh for toll. Paytm had said that the charge was due to a technical error and had rectified the same.\nFastag is a prepaid toll collection system that uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. When a vehicle passes through a toll plaza, the RFID tag in the Fastag is read and the toll amount is deducted from the user\u2019s account.\nThe Fastag system has been praised for its convenience and for reducing traffic congestion at toll plazas. However, the recent incidents have raised concerns about the reliability of the system. The NHAI and Paytm need to take steps to address these concerns and to ensure that the Fastag system is a reliable and convenient way to pay tolls.\nPNN\nSuggest A Correction": "```\n(\"entity\"$$$$Paytm$$$$Company$$$$Paytm is a digital payment and financial services company in India that offers a variety of services including mobile recharges, utility bill payments, and Fastag services.)\n(\"entity\"$$$$FASTag$$$$Product$$$$FASTag is a prepaid toll collection system that uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.)\n(\"entity\"$$$$NHAI$$$$Organization$$$$NHAI (National Highways Authority of India) is responsible for the management of national highways in India.)\n(\"entity\"$$$$gsratta$$$$Person$$$$gsratta is a user on the Team-bhp forum who reported being charged Rs 9 crore for toll at Mayar toll plaza near Hisar in Haryana due to a technical glitch in the Paytm Fastag system.)\n(\"entity\"$$$$Emvi$$$$Person$$$$Emvi is another user on the Team-bhp forum who shared a screenshot showing he was charged Rs 1.5 crore for toll, also due to a technical glitch in the Paytm Fastag system.)\n(\"entity\"$$$$Mayar Toll Plaza$$$$Location$$$$Mayar Toll Plaza is a toll collection point near Hisar in Haryana where the reported incidents of exorbitant toll charges occurred.)\n(\"entity\"$$$$Team-bhp$$$$Forum$$$$Team-bhp is an online forum where users discuss various automotive-related topics, including issues with Fastag toll charges.)\n\n(\"relationship\"$$$$Paytm$$$$FASTag$$$$Provides$$$$Paytm provides the Fastag service, which is a prepaid toll collection system using RFID technology.)\n(\"relationship\"$$$$gsratta$$$$Paytm$$$$Customer-Service$$$$gsratta is a customer of Paytm who reported an issue with being charged Rs 9 crore for toll due to a technical glitch in the Fastag system.)\n```",

Watt has yet to properly file his retirement with the NFL\nThe Houston Texans have ramped up their defensive needs with the reported signing of Maliek Collins on Wednesday, June 14.\nAccording to Adam Schefter of ESPN, both sides sealed the deal on a contract extension with Collins accepting a $23 million contract extension.\n\"The deal was negotiated by Texans' GM Nick Caserio and director of football administration Andrew Brown with Collins' agents Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha,\" the scribe wrote on his Twitter post\nThe new deal gives Collins a bit of a raise and reportedly includes a $20 million guarantee.\nIn his previous contract, the 28-year-old was earning $17 million with $8.5 million of that guaranteed.\nThis will be his third year in the NFL, having had previous stops with the Dallas Cowboys (2016-2019) and the Las Vegas Raiders (2020).\nThe Kansas native had a career-high 37 tackles to go with 3.5 sacks over 15 games last NFL season.\nHe is projected to be a key piece in the defensive line of the Texans for the next couple of years.\nLooking ahead, Collins is expected to fit in nicely with the 4-3 alignment that DeMeco Ryans is expected to implement.\nHe is likely to become a full-time defensive tackle according to Sam Robison of Pro Football Talk.\nWith the Texans in rebuilding mode, Collins was seen as one of the bright spots for the team. He started 15 games between 2021 and 2022, combining for six sacks and 18 tackles for a loss.\nNow, he will be paid better, which means he will have added responsibility\u2013particularly on the defensive side of the Texans' fence.\nThe Collins deal also comes not long after other defensive tackles landed new deals with their respective teams. That list includes Dexter Lawrence, Daron Payne, Jeffery Simmons and Ed Oliver.\nThere are still other names expected to land new contracts this NFL offseason. Yet to come to terms with their teams include Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs and Quinnen Williams of the New York Jets.\nIn related news, there remain questions in the air on whether J.J. Watt is officially retired.\nAccording to a report by CBS Sports, Watt has yet to fill out his retirement papers with the NFL.\nThis was despite his retiring last NFL season in an emotional game that saw him record two sacks in his allegedly final NFL game.\nMoreover, the five-time first-team All-Pro does not intend to sign a one-day deal with the Texans although this is tied to him being inducted into the club's Ring of Honor.\n\"I personally just don't really understand or see the reason for it,\" Watt stated. \"It's more just a ceremonial piece of paper. I think that the Ring of Honor and all that comes with it is more than enough.\"": "```plaintext\n(\"entity\"$$$$Houston Texans$$$$Organization$$$$The Houston Texans are a professional American football team based in Houston, Texas.

Around that juncture, New England reportedly reached out to the star wide receiver\u2019s team to express interest. Those conversations birthed a free-agent visit, which reportedly started Wednesday in Foxboro, Mass. and carried into Thursday morning.\n\u201cI just got official word: DeAndre Hopkins is in New England,\u201d NFL insider Jeremy Fowler said Thursday on ESPN\u2019s \u201cGet Up.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s meeting with the Patriots. He will meet with the coaches, Bill Belichick. The Patriots\u2019 interest remains high. They made that clear with Hopkins\u2019 representatives from the very beginning when he became a free agent. So, we\u2019ll see if they can close on this thing.\u201d\nHopkins has received co-signs from New England team leaders like Mac Jones and Matthew Judon, and the Patriots reportedly are optimistic they can add the five-time Pro Bowl selection. But even if Hopkins\u2019 meeting with the Patriots goes well, don\u2019t be surprised if the 31-year-old leaves New England without a deal.\n\u201cI\u2019m also told Hopkins (is) not in a major rush,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking at more of training camp, even early August as more of a harder deadline for him to sign somewhere. So, it would have to be a very sweet offer for New England to make that happen today.\u201d\nThe Patriots appear to be the second team Hopkins met with as a free agent.

Ryanair said staff should be able to come to work \"in a safe and secure environment\".\n\"We would ask all of you to respect the privacy and integrity of those brave individuals who came forward to assist us in this investigation,\" Mr Hughes added.\nThe Financial Times reported that Mr Murray has seven days to launch an appeal against his dismissal.\nThe BBC has attempted to contact Mr Murray for comment.\nThe job of chief pilot is an important one. The holder is both a highly qualified airline captain and a manager, responsible for overseeing other pilots based at a hub airport.\nThey are usually in charge of issues such as training, flight coordination and rostering as well as addressing personal issues. They can also represent the airline in disciplinary issues.\nAs such, they have a lot of power over their fellow pilots, particularly more junior ones seeking promotions.\nThe suggestion that someone in this position might be abusing their power - and behaving in an \"inappropriate and unacceptable\" way towards female staff - is therefore a very serious charge.\nIt's important to note that we haven't heard the other side of the story. But it appears that whistleblowers have come forward - and have been listened to.\nAgainst that background, the dismissal should come as no surprise.\nA report last year by the Royal Aeronautical Society into discrimination and lack of diversity in airline pilot training found \"extremely concerning\" reports of sexism and sexual harassment by many female pilots.\nAlthough many had positive comments on their training, reports of sexism and harassment ranged from \"banter\" to \"uncomfortable advances from male trainers\".\nRelated Topics\nSexual harassment\nRyanair\nMore on this story\nPilot, 15, wants to inspire more women into gliding\n2 hours ago\nHeathrow workers call off first summer strikes\n2 days ago": "```\n(\"entity\"$$$$Ryanair$$$$Organization$$$$Ryanair is a major European airline known for its low-cost flights.

That was the biggest percentage decline since it sank 7.2% on June 11, 2020.\nThe stock's price decline of $31.45 was the second-biggest since it started trading in October 1984, behind only the $47.00 (17.3%) plunge on March 16, 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe selloff was cut about 207 points off the Dow's price, as the Dow fell 232.79 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.1%.\nThe selloff comes after Chief Financial Officer John Rex said late Tuesday at a Goldman Sachs investor conference that there were indications of \"pent-up demand\" from senior citizens to have hip and knee procedures and cardiology checkups, which could hurt results from UnitedHealth's Medicare business.\nOppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn said while other insurers that presented at recent conferences didn't mention similar trends, he believed UnitedHealth's comments will weigh on the entire sector.\nHe said rival Humana Inc. (HUM) was potentially the most exposed, given its larger Medicare Advantage presence. And on cue, Humana's stock was the S&P 500's biggest decliner, tumbling 13.8%.\nSome of the S&P 500's other big losers were also in the Medicare Advantage business, as Centene Corp.'s (CNC) stock sank 6.9%, Elevance Health Inc. (ELV) shares shed 6.8% and CVS Health Corp.'s (CVS) stock slid 7.8%.\nUnitedHealth's stock has an outsized impact on the Dow's price\nUnitedHealth's stock is the highest-priced component of the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, unlike the S&P 500, which is a market-capitalization-weighted index. That means the stock's moves affect the Dow more than any other component.\nAt Wednesday's closing prices, a 1% move in UnitedHealth's stock represents about a 30-point move in the Dow, while a 1% move in Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s (WBA) stock, which is the lowest priced, has about a 2-point effect on the Dow.\n-Tomi Kilgore\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 25% over a half decade. In contrast, the stock price has popped 9.8% in the last thirty days. However, this may be a matter of broader market optimism, since stocks are up 6.8% in the same time.\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\nView our latest analysis for State Street\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, State Street actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 6.1% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.\nBecause of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.\nRevenue is actually up 0.5% over the time period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nState Street is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for State Street in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.\nWe're pleased to report that State Street shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over one year. That's including the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions.

They had $15.85 billion in mark-to-market profits in 2022.\nSee also: Elon Musk? Jay Powell? Tell MarketWatch who the 50 most influential people in markets are today\n\"With [Tesla's] stock price continuing its recent upward trend we should see continued short covering as the [Tesla] short squeeze tightens its hold on short sellers, especially those with less conviction,\" Dusaniwsky said.\nAfter a difficult April, when it fell 20%, Tesla stock was on a tear in May, and has kept that up in June, gaining about 60% in the period. For the year, the stock has gained 110%, which compares with an advance of about 14% for the S&P 500 index.\nThe most recent gains for the stock came as Tesla saw its fast-charging standard becoming the de facto standard in the U.S.\nLast week, Tesla and General Motors Co. announced that GM EV owners would have access to Tesla's \"Supercharger\" network, usually located near major highways.\nGM also said that its future EVs would conform to the Tesla-developed North America Charging Standard, or NACS, by 2025, and before that the automaker would offer an adapter. That follows a similar move by Ford Motor Co. last month\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said back in July 2021 that he would open Tesla's Supercharger to other EVs, although he promised that would happen by the end of 2021.\nTesla created its own connector because there were no standards when it became the only maker of long-range EVs, Musk said then.\nOther EVs began to be allowed to charge at Tesla's fast-charging stations last year, but the GM (GM) and Ford (F) announcements brought the matter to the forefront.\nGM, Ford and other automakers currently use the Combined Charging System, or CCS, as their charging connection, which is standard in most EVs in Europe and other regions. Tesla has made NACS open source, which means more products that use it are hitting the market.\nSee related:Tesla again raises starting price of Model Y by $250 in U.S\n-Claudia Assis\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Selected other teams across Pots Three and Four include AC Milan, Real Sociedad and Celtic.\nThat means City could face a run of fixtures like Liverpool at home, Real Madrid away, and Tottenham at home - or Brighton at home, Inter Milan away, and Manchester United away.\nAssuming City qualify for the last-16, the first leg could take place on one of two midweeks in February. Either it could be played in between Premier League home fixtures against Everton and Chelsea, or it could be played between the Chelsea game and a trip to Bournemouth.\nThe second leg will be played in the middle of a difficult March fixture list, either between United at home and Liverpool away, or between Liverpool away and Brighton away.\nShould City progress to the quarter-finals, the first leg will come after the trip to Crystal Palace and before the visit of Luton. The second leg, a week later, will be played before the ever-difficult trip to Tottenham. However, should City or Spurs reach the FA Cup semi-finals, that would likely cause the Premier League game to be rearranged.\nOn to the potential semi-finals, and City face Nottingham Forest away before the first legs on April 30 or May 1. Then Wolves visit City at the weekend, before the second leg on May 7 or 8, and then a tricky trip to Fulham.\nALSO READ:\nFive key Man City dates as 2023/24 Premier League fixtures released": "```plaintext\n(\"entity\"$$$$Real Madrid$$$$Football Club$$$$Real Madrid is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain.
